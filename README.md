# DuelingDQN
This repository contains an implementation of a Dueling Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN) agent trained to play Atari Pong using RAM state inputs from the `ALE/Pong-ram-v5` environment in Gymnasium. The agent uses Double DQN, experience replay &amp; epsilon-greedy action selection to stabilize learning.
